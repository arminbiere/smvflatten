SmvFlatten is a tool to flatten programs in the input language of the SMV
model checker (CMU, Cadence, IRST).  The output is again an SMV program with
one toplevel module and only boolean variables and operations. All
equivalent sections of the SMV program are merged.  In addition
undeterministic expressions are removed by syntactic quantification or the
introduction of additional primary inputs (oracles).  SmvFlatten operates on
the syntactical level only and does not use BDDs or MTBDDs.

If you think of the SMV language as a hardware description language, then
SmvFlatten is a rudimentary synthesis tool that compiles RTL models to gate
level.  Some simple optimizations are included as well.

The output format, the gate level SMV format, is suited as input for the
model checker backend parser FlatSmv.  FlatSmv uses the backannotation that
SmvFlatten puts into comments for the generation of non-flattened
counterexample traces.  In the future we plan to add a Verilog and a VHDL
backend as well.

For more information on how to run SmvFlatten see the summary of command
line option summary, that is printed if the '-h' option is used.
